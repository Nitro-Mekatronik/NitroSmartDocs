# Fully-managed private cloud hosting for nopCommerce

The nopCommerce team in collaboration with the Everleap Managed Services has launched the Fully-managed Private Cloud hosting for mission-critical websites to boost their performance and increase reliability. We proactively monitor your application. If we see any issues, we will notify you and provide solutions or recommendations for resolution.

To better understand your hosting requirements, we offer you a free consultation. Based on your requests, we will design a customized hosting infrastructure to meet your business needs and provide you with a flat monthly fee. For your convenience, we also offer free database and website migration services.

## Benefits of using our private cloud

*-* **High performance.** Your website will be the only one on the server, so there is no resource contention leading to performance degradation.

*-* **Unlimited scalability.** Scaling and upgrading your hosting infrastructure will not be disruptive, with minimum or no downtime.

*-* **Flat monthly cost.** The custom infrastructure is designed to meet your technical and business requirements without charging you for increasing traffic or any other user activities on your website.

*-* **Better security.** Lower security risks since there is an individual web host for your project and no one would upload a vulnerable third-party application.

*-* **Free 24/7 technical support.** You will also get 2 hours of advanced support services per month (e.g. DBA consultation).
